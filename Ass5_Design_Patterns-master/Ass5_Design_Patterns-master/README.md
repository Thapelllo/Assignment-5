# HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN DOMAIN MODEL
## Introduction
The reasons for getting health insurance are not far from getting other insurance first of all you want to protect your family and yourself. Medical costs go up all the time and medical bills can overwhelm you if you do not have a health insurance cover when you are sick or injured. As we would know, where there is money, the living conditions also improve. Fortunately when the standard of living has improved, people start to worry about their health more among other things. 

Apart from living a healthy lifestyle it is imperative that you buy a health Insurance policy to cover for unexpected costs usually brought by poor health. Who can predict when an illness will attack? More often than not we find ourselves suffering from things we never heard of before and/or have no idea how they attacked us. If you are not covered, such times can be very tiring.
## South Africa Medical Insurance system
It is imperative to note that the South African Health Insurance industry structure is slightly different from the rest of the globe. Despite the fact that there are similarities of local health insurance companies most terms and conditions with that of traditional health insurance policies, there is a clear difference which is a guarantee of a minimum standard of services offered by particular insurance schemes to those people who have applied for them. As a result, the health insurance quotes do not come to you directly if you are employed as insurance companies would send them to you through your immediate employer.
## Current state of Medical Insurance in South Africa
There have been some major improvements in the Health Insurance Industry in recent years particularly in the way it renders its services to the South African public. The general objective of the industry is to come up with policies that are promptly accessible to the general public. Unfortunately, the majority of Health Insurance Policies are still offered through employers only, and as a result employers enjoy the advantages. To this end, only employers have the privilege to negotiate with the insurer the terms of the health insurance on behalf of employees. This way the employer ensures that the insurance company they are dealing with provides the most affordable rates ever, at the same time making sure the cover makes sense for the employees. It is a good deal for those employed since covers negotiated by their employers are favourable to them. However, this arrangement by the insurance companies does not help those who are unemployed but wish to buy a health insurance policy. Currently, as indicated above, health insurance is enjoyed mostly by those who are employed. Even if you get the insurance when you are unemployed chances are that the cover would still be very expensive. It is something that insurance companies have to deal with or change as time goes by because health insurance is not only afforded by those who are employed and the unemployed are at a disadvantage
